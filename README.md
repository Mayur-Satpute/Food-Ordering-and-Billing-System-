# 🍴 Food Ordering and Billing System (Python Console App)

[cite\_start]A practical, console-based **Food Ordering and Billing System** developed in **Python**[cite: 8]. [cite\_start]This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and basic data handling, providing a complete, beginner-friendly application[cite: 8].

## 📌 Description

[cite\_start]This application simulates a real-world restaurant system[cite: 8]. [cite\_start]It is built entirely as a console interface and uses Python's core features to manage user authentication, menu presentation, order processing, and bill generation[cite: 8]. [cite\_start]It also includes an administrative panel for system monitoring[cite: 8].

## 🚀 Key Features

  * [cite\_start]**User Registration & Login** ✅ – Securely create and manage user accounts[cite: 8].
  * [cite\_start]**Menu-Driven Ordering** 📋 – Users can easily select from a defined menu of Veg and Non-Veg items[cite: 8].
  * [cite\_start]**Automatic Bill Generation** 💵 – Calculates the total cost of all ordered items automatically[cite: 8].
  * [cite\_start]**Admin Dashboard** 🔑 – Access to view all registered users and a full history of all customer orders[cite: 8].
